# Intro

This chrome plugin for gmail makes it easy to navigate with the keyboard through the links of the email messages you are reading.
It's a very simple plugin that will make your tab key smarter. When pressing it with an email message open, it's first link will be focused. Currently the focused link will be the first of the page.
Unfortunatelly, gmail doesn't have this feature. Hope they implement it in the near future.

# Installation

Just go to https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/akjoipaaogecajpgalccncadjjdogfla

# Try it out

This plugin doesn't add anything visible to your browser, so,
do the following to try it out:

* Enter your gmail web-client;
* Open an email message that contains a link;
* Press the tab key.

You should notice that the first link is focused, and from that you can navigate to all the links on the email message.
