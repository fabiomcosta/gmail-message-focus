# Intro

This chrome plugin for gmail makes it easy to navigate with the keyboard through the links of the email messages you are reading.
It's a very simple plugin that will make your tab key smarter. When pressing it with an email message open, it's first link will be focused. Currently the focused link will be the first of the page.
Unfortunatelly, gmail doesn't have this feature. Hope they implement it in the near future.
